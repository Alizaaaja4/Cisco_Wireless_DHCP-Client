Pratice Simulation Wireless Network witch DHCP-Client in Cisco Packet Tracer

Repository Title : Simulation of Wireless DHCP Client in Cisco Packet Tracer

Description : This simulation aims to visualize the concept of using a wireless connection with a DHCP Client. There are six rooms, each equipped with two computers, three laptops, two tablets, two smartphones, and two printers. All these devices are connected to a wireless network using the Access Point. The simulation is designed to demonstrate the functions and configuration of wireless connections in an office network environment.

## DHCP Client
DHCP client is a software or hardware device on a computer network that automatically sends requests to obtain IP address configurations and other network information from a DHCP server. The DHCP client is used to dynamically configure IP addresses and other network settings, allowing devices to connect to the network without manual configuration.
